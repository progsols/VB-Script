Accessing a Database from an ASP Page
The common way to access a database from inside an ASP page is to:
Create an ADO connection to a database
Open the database connection
Create an ADO recordset
Open the recordset
Extract the data you need from the recordset
Close the recordset
Close the connection
DNS
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality on the Internet, that has been in use since 1985.
IIS
Internet Information Services (IIS, formerly Internet Information Server) is an extensible web server created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family.[2] IIS supports HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP and NNTP. It has been an integral part of the Windows NT family since Windows NT 4.0, though it may be absent from some editions (e.g. Windows XP Home edition), and is not active by default.
Global.asa
The Global.asa file is an optional file that can contain declarations of objects, variables, and methods that can be accessed by every page in an ASP application. All valid browser scripts (JavaScript, VBScript, JScript, PerlScript, etc.) can be used within Global.asa.
The Global.asa file can contain only the following:
Application events
Session events
<object> declarations
TypeLibrary declarations
the #include directive
Events in Global.asa
In Global.asa you can tell the application and session objects what to do when the application/session starts and what to do when the application/session ends. The code for this is placed in event handlers. The Global.asa file can contain four types of events:
Application_OnStart - Occurs when the FIRST user calls the first page in an ASP application. This event occurs after the Web server is restarted or after the Global.asa file is edited. The "Session_OnStart" event occurs immediately after this event.
Session_OnStart - This event occurs EVERY time a NEW user requests his or her first page in the ASP application.
Session_OnEnd - This event occurs EVERY time a user ends a session. A user-session ends after a page has not been requested by the user for a specified time (by default this is 20 minutes).
Application_OnEnd - This event occurs after the LAST user has ended the session. Typically, this event occurs when a Web server stops. This procedure is used to clean up settings after the Application stops, like delete records or write information to text files.
