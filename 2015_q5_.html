Session
“session” is one of those computing terms that refers to seemingly different things : a shell session, a tcp session, a login session, a desktop session, a browser session, a server session etc. This makes it confusing to understand what exactly a session is. Same for the “cache”, another confusing term (database cache, browser cache, framework cache, network cache..). But actually what defines those confusing terms is the use they’re describing.
Use of a session
Generally you should understand the session as the different states of an application during the time a user is interacting with it, it is specific to the user. I would even say a session is an instance of the interaction of a user with an application, but I’m not sure it clarifies the matter. Now more specifically for a web session, the session is a data structure that an application uses to store temporary data that is useful only during the time a user is interacting with the application, it is also specific to the user.For example, you could save the user’s name in the session so that you don’t have to query the database every time you need it or you could store data in the session to save state between pages (between pages of a payment process for example). Think of it as a volatile memory quickly accessible that is allocated to each user who is using the application, and when the user quits, it is destroyed. This is the general concept, the storage mechanism and how it is implemented is then specific to the application. This temporary storage could be on the file system in text files, on a database or in the internal memory of the program executing the application.
Difference between Sub and Function
In function we can return values as boolean, string and other data data types. but sub does not return any thing. it just executes code and instruction that we give. These are also regarded as methods Sub is also used in control's events and these events also not return any value.
for example the click event of a command button: Private sub cmd_click()
end sub
CSS class
The .class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class. You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. To do this, start with the element name, then write the period (.) character, followed by the name of the class (look at Example 1 below). HTML elements can also refer to more than one class
.intro {
    background-color: yellow;
}
Query string
The QueryString collection is used to retrieve the variable values in the HTTP query string. The HTTP query string is specified by the values following the question mark (?), like this: <a href= "test.asp?txt=this is a query string test">Link with a query string</a> The line above generates a variable named txt with the value "this is a query string test". Query strings are also generated by form submission, or by a user typing a query into the address bar of the browser. If you want to send large amounts of data (beyond 100 kb) the Request.QueryString cannot be used.
Request.QueryString(variable)[(index)|.Count]
