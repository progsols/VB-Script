The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
The target attribute can have one of the following values:
 _blank - Opens the linked document in a new window or tab
_self - Opens the linked document in the same window/tab as it was clicked (this is default)
_parent - Opens the linked document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the linked document in the full body of the window
framename - Opens the linked document in a named frame

Create a Bookmark
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a Web page. Bookmarks can be useful if your webpage is very long. To make a bookmark, you must first create the bookmark, and then add a link to it. When the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.
